# Project Automated

Empower your practice with automated open workflows! Take control by automating key tasks in Architecture Design, Engineering, Construction, and Building Operations. Free yourself from repetitive tasks and focus on what truly mattersâ€”solving the real design challenges.

Adopt efficient workflows with minimal cost. The automated workflows are built using Open-Source Software, Standards, and Hardware. Learn them easily and integrate them into your practice without the burden of heavy costs.

**Powering practices to achieve more with less.**
